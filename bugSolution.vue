The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind's JIT mode correctly processes the CSS before the framework interprets it.  This typically requires adjusting the build process of your framework.  If you're using a build tool like Vite or Webpack, you need to make sure that Tailwind's CSS processing happens before the framework's CSS processing.

Here's an example illustrating proper setup for Vite (Adjust according to your framework and build tool). In your `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue';
import { createSvgIconsPlugin } from 'vite-plugin-svg-icons';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
  return {
    plugins: [
      vue(),
      createSvgIconsPlugin({
        iconDirs: [path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'src/assets/icons')],
        symbolId: 'icon-[dir]-[name]',
      }),
    ],
    css: {
      preprocessorOptions: {
        scss: {
          additionalData: `@import './src/styles/variables.scss';`,
        },
      },
    },
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
      },
    },
  };
});
```

Ensure that your Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) is correctly set up to include your components and is compatible with your framework. Also, confirm that Tailwind's postcss setup is correct within your build pipeline.  You might need to add plugins or adjust the order of plugins in your webpack or vite configuration to ensure Tailwind runs before your framework's CSS processing.
