This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Vue.js or React.  It arises because Tailwind's `@apply` directive isn't directly compatible with the way these frameworks process CSS.  While Tailwind compiles your CSS, the framework might be trying to interpret `@apply` before the compilation is complete, resulting in the error. This often manifests as a missing or incorrectly applied style.
